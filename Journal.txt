This is the first day that our proffessor Mr. Paul Pajo. Gave us an assignment to make a journal about what we do 
and to post it on Github. 

This day, is normal, i get to get to school on time. Played computer for an hour, then got home to do my assignments
which include this one.

I am not used to this, so i dont know how to end or start this :D

Bye for now
