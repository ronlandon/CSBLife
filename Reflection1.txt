Frosh Orientation


I really think that i need it cause it is the first day in my whole college life
 
I might as well start it right.

With this orientation, I got to know what college really is.

I got my handbook which help me to know more about the rules of this school.

There is a lot of topic to discuss and I am glad that i listened.

I gained new friends and get to know who is my blockmate.

They will be my blockmatess dor 2 terms its a good thing to know them.

We played games as an ice breaker which makes everybody feels good about each other and what

put us in good mood.

I as exited as anyone is, I am happy that I am a frosh and going to study in a good college.

And i think in someday we may do what they did in there.
