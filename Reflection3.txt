In the second part, we killed the earth. All is bad in the environment. This is

what we are avoiding even now. We should be aware on what we have and know that

it wont last forever. We should know how to preserve and be careful on what we do

and even improve to a non polluting way of living. It affects me cause we all have our

own responsibilities to take care of our surroundings. To not get it go to waste, 

or to put waste on it. We should be thoughtful enough to recycle or to conserve

energy to avoid destroying our own home. Value that can be shown is our social responsibilities

we should do our own part, lets stop complaining and start moving and a sense of nationhood 

we should be care for our country before any others. The play is very creative and this is

the second time that i watch a shadow show which impresses me a lot.
