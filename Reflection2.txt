The value that i realize is the creativity. It shows the creativity of the a child

and what will be when another kid is with is him/her. The imagination of both child

never ends, their ideas of things never stop.The shadow show truly shows the creativity 

that even the shadow that follow us everday may be a key or may be used to make a good

show and a very entertaining event. I like how they make the story about how she was born

That she was an angel and her wings was torn off and hidden. It will be returned when

she grows old. That simple things can make a difficult person happy, and just go with

the flow. Creativity is what struck me the most, it is the most abundant value there, which

is good, as a game designer i should have the same creativty or even more. The show is worth the money. It have to show iin 1 event which is good and the content

was great and entertaining.
