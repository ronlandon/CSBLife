I attend this event because i wanted to know the oppurtinites i will get if i graduated

from college. Even though you I am a GDD student it may help me also

where is the good way to start and what is the right thing to do.

It teaches us the experiences that the professionals in that event gone through, 

and the wrong things that they did so that we could now do it.

I want to be in a big part if I am any lucky in any gaming industry.

They are games and raffles int the middle of the event which i enjoyed

but I didnt won.

Any company will do for me as long as it pays well and are good to me.

There are a lot of story that have very important lessons in it.

We are tought the life in the working world and how hard to keep up.

I realize that me to will have that experiences when i start working

so I am pretty exited about working after college.

They gave us free food and drink after the event and went home.
